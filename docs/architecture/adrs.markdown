- RxJS integration for reactive patterns

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Predictable state mutations through actions
- Easy debugging with action history
- Performance optimization through memoization
- Clear separation of concerns between state and UI
- Excellent testability with pure functions

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity compared to simple services
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Redux patterns
- Boilerplate code for actions, reducers, and selectors

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Utility functions to reduce boilerplate
- TypeScript integration for type safety
