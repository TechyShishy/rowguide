## Critical Architecture Fix: StepComponent Design Flaw

### Problem Discovery

During comprehensive unit testing of the StepComponent, a fundamental design flaw was discovered in the component's property architecture:

**Issue**: Mixed property ownership where external inputs could conflict with internal reactive state management.

```typescript
// BEFORE (Flawed Design)
export class StepComponent {
  @Input() isZoomed = false;        // External input
  @Input() isFirstStep = false;     // External input  
  @Input() isLastStep = false;      // External input
  
  // Internal observables would override these properties
  // causing confusion about single source of truth
}
```

### Architectural Solution

Implemented the **read-only properties pattern** to establish clear property ownership:

```typescript
// AFTER (Fixed Design)
export class StepComponent {
  // Private backing fields for internal state
  private _isZoomed = false;
  private _isFirstStep = false;
  private _isLastStep = false;

  // Read-only public getters
  get isZoomed(): boolean { return this._isZoomed; }
  get isFirstStep(): boolean { return this._isFirstStep; }
  get isLastStep(): boolean { return this._isLastStep; }

  // Only externally settable properties remain as @Input
  @Input() isCurrentStep = false;
  @Input() marked = false;
}
```

### Technical Benefits

1. **Clear Ownership**: Internal reactive state managed by component, external state via inputs
2. **Type Safety**: Read-only properties prevent external mutation
3. **Reactive Architecture**: Clean separation between external data and internal derived state
4. **Testing Reliability**: Predictable component behavior for comprehensive testing

### Business Impact

- **Reliability**: Eliminated state inconsistency bugs in pattern navigation
- **Maintainability**: Clear component API with defined responsibilities
- **User Experience**: Consistent behavior in pattern tracking interface
- **Development Velocity**: Easier debugging and component interaction understanding

## Comprehensive Testing Methodology

  }).toThrow();
});
```
