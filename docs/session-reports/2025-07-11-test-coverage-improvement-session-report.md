## Critical Bug Resolution: ZipperService

### Bug Details

- **Location**: `zipperSteps` method in ZipperService
- **Issue**: Duplicate step creation when merging arrays of different lengths
- **Root Cause**: Flawed forEach implementation with incorrect bounds handling
- **Impact**: Data corruption in pattern file processing workflows

### Fix Implementation

```typescript
// Before (buggy)
expandedSteps1.forEach((step, index) => {
  expandedZippedSteps.push(step);
  if (expandedSteps2[index]) {
    expandedZippedSteps.push(expandedSteps2[index]);
  }
});
// Additional problematic logic for length differences

// After (corrected)
for (let index = 0; index < maxLength; index++) {
  if (expandedSteps1[index]) {
    expandedZippedSteps.push(expandedSteps1[index]);
  }
  if (expandedSteps2[index]) {
    expandedZippedSteps.push(expandedSteps2[index]);
  }
}
```
