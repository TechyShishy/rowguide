# ðŸ“‹ Development Session Reports

This directory contains detailed reports from development sessions, tracking progress, decisions, and outcomes for the Rowguide project.

## About Session Reports

Session reports provide:
- **Detailed progress tracking** for each development session
- **Technical decisions** and their rationale
- **Implementation details** and code changes
- **Challenges encountered** and solutions applied
- **Next steps** and future planning

## All Session Reports

{% assign session_reports = site.pages | where_exp: "page", "page.path contains 'session-reports/'" | where_exp: "page", "page.name != 'README.markdown'" | sort: "name" | reverse %}

{% if session_reports.size > 0 %}
<div class="session-reports-list">
{% for report in session_reports %}
  <div class="session-report-item">
    <h3>
      {% if report.title %}
        <a href="{{ report.url | relative_url }}">{{ report.title }}</a>
      {% else %}
        <a href="{{ report.url | relative_url }}">{{ report.name | remove: '.md' | remove: '.markdown' }}</a>
      {% endif %}
    </h3>

    {% if report.date %}
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> {{ report.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}</p>
    {% endif %}

    {% if report.excerpt %}
    <p>{{ report.excerpt | strip_html | truncate: 200 }}</p>
    {% endif %}

    <hr>
  </div>
{% endfor %}
</div>
{% else %}
<p><em>No session reports found.</em></p>
{% endif %}

## Report Structure

Each session report typically includes:

1. **Session Overview** - Goals, scope, and participants
2. **Technical Implementation** - Code changes and architectural decisions
3. **Progress Summary** - Completed tasks and milestones
4. **Challenges & Solutions** - Issues encountered and resolutions
5. **Next Steps** - Future work and action items
6. **Metrics & Outcomes** - Measurable results and improvements

## Contributing to Session Reports

### Creating New Reports

Use the following naming convention for new session reports:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description-session-report.md
```

### Required Front Matter

```yaml
---
layout: page
title: "Session Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
excerpt: "Brief description of the session"
---
```

### Recommended Sections

1. **Session Goals** - What was planned
2. **Implementation Details** - What was built
3. **Technical Decisions** - Why certain approaches were chosen
4. **Challenges** - What problems were encountered
5. **Solutions** - How problems were solved
6. **Results** - What was accomplished
7. **Next Steps** - Future work items

## Integration with Development Process

Session reports are part of the broader development documentation:

- **[Implementation Checklist](../implementation-checklist.markdown)** - Overall project progress
- **[Code Quality Plan](../code-quality-improvement-plan.markdown)** - Quality improvement roadmap
- **[Architecture Guide](../architecture/)** - Technical architecture decisions
- **[API Documentation](../api/)** - Complete JSDoc examples and implementation patterns

## Metrics and Tracking

Session reports help track:
- **Velocity** - Development speed and efficiency
- **Quality** - Code quality improvements over time
- **Technical Debt** - Accumulated technical debt and resolution
- **Knowledge Transfer** - Decision rationale and learning outcomes
