# Implementation Checklist & Progress Tracking

## Project Status Overview

**Last Updated**: August 4, 2025
**Current Phase**: Phase 4 - Advanced Testing & Quality
**Test Coverage**: 886/886 tests passing (71.85% statement coverage)
**Implementation Focus**: Expanding test coverage and implementing advanced testing patterns

---

## **PHASE 4: ADVANCED TESTING & QUALITY**

**Objective**: Achieve enterprise-grade testing standards with 95%+ coverage, comprehensive E2E testing, and advanced quality assurance patterns
**Priority**: HIGH

### **1. Foundation: Test Coverage Analysis**

**Start Here** - Understand current state

- ✅ **Current foundation**: 886 unit tests and 71.85% statement coverage
- [ ] **Expand from 71.85% to 95%+ coverage** (significant gap remaining)
  - [ ] Run detailed coverage analysis to identify specific files with low coverage

### **2. Core Unit Tests**

**Build on**: Coverage analysis results

- [ ] **Add unit tests for gaps identified in coverage analysis**
  - [ ] Focus on uncovered service methods and business logic
  - [ ] Add tests for error handling and edge cases
  - [ ] Cover component lifecycle methods and event handlers
  - [ ] Test utility functions and data model validation

### **3. Integration Testing**

**Build on**: Solid unit test foundation

- ✅ **Basic integration testing patterns exist**
- [ ] **Need systematic integration testing suite for component interactions**

  _Known architectural gaps (based on system design):_
  - [ ] Create integration tests for ProjectService + ProjectDbService interactions
  - [ ] Create integration tests for ReactiveStateStore + component interactions
  - [ ] Create integration tests for ErrorHandlerService + logging integrations
  - [ ] Create integration tests for DataIntegrityService + file operations

  _Additional gaps to discover:_
  - [ ] Identify other service integration points during coverage analysis
  - [ ] Test cross-cutting concerns (authentication, validation, error propagation)

### **4. E2E Workflow Coverage**

**Build on**: Integration tests validating system behavior

- ✅ **Playwright fully set up with 150 tests and page object models**
- [ ] **Need comprehensive coverage of all user workflows**
  - [ ] Add E2E tests for project creation and import workflows
  - [ ] Add E2E tests for pattern navigation and position tracking
  - [ ] Add E2E tests for settings and configuration management
  - [ ] Add E2E tests for error scenarios and recovery flows

### **5. Visual & Accessibility Testing**

**Build on**: Comprehensive functional coverage

- [ ] **Need visual regression testing implementation**
  - [ ] Install and configure Playwright visual comparison tools
  - [ ] Create baseline screenshots for all major UI components
  - [ ] Add visual regression tests for responsive design breakpoints
  - [ ] Integrate visual regression testing into CI/CD pipeline

- [ ] **Accessibility testing automation (axe-core integration)**
  - [ ] Install and configure @axe-core/playwright
  - [ ] Add automated accessibility tests to all page components
  - [ ] Add accessibility tests for dynamic content and interactions
  - [ ] Add accessibility tests for keyboard navigation flows
  - [ ] Create accessibility test reporting and monitoring

### **6. Cross-Platform Testing**

**Build on**: Visual and accessibility testing ensuring consistent UX

- ✅ **Performance and accessibility testing framework in place**
- [ ] **Visual regression testing for UI changes**
  - [ ] Add visual regression tests for theme and accessibility states
  - [ ] Add mobile device emulation testing scenarios
  - [ ] Validate consistent behavior across all target platforms

### **7. Advanced Quality Patterns**

**Build on**: Comprehensive functional and visual test coverage

- [ ] **Contract testing for service interfaces**
  - [ ] Install and configure Pact.js for contract testing
  - [ ] Define service contracts for ProjectService interfaces
  - [ ] Define service contracts for ReactiveStateStore interactions
  - [ ] Create provider-side contract verification tests
  - [ ] Integrate contract testing into CI/CD pipeline

- [ ] **Property-based testing for complex business logic**
  - [ ] Install and configure fast-check for property-based testing
  - [ ] Create property-based tests for data validation functions
  - [ ] Create property-based tests for state management operations
  - [ ] Create property-based tests for mathematical calculations

### **8. Test Quality Validation**

**Build on**: All functional tests in place, now validate test quality itself

- ✅ **Parallel test execution working with Playwright**
- ✅ **Basic test data management patterns exist**
- [ ] **Mutation testing to validate test quality**
  - [ ] Install and configure Stryker.js for mutation testing
  - [ ] Configure mutation testing for critical service layers
  - [ ] Set up mutation testing quality thresholds and reporting
  - [ ] Integrate mutation testing into CI/CD quality gates

- [ ] **Comprehensive performance benchmarks**
  - [ ] Add memory usage monitoring to E2E tests
  - [ ] Add CPU usage profiling for complex operations
  - [ ] Create performance regression detection system
  - [ ] Set up performance monitoring dashboards and alerts

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

- **✅ Completion Criteria:**
  - [ ] Achieve 95%+ statement coverage (from current 71.85%)
  - [ ] Complete E2E test coverage for all critical user workflows
  - [ ] Implement contract testing for service interfaces
  - [ ] Add automated accessibility testing with axe-core integration
  - [ ] Implement visual regression testing for UI changes
  - [ ] Add property-based testing for complex business logic
  - [ ] Set up mutation testing to validate test quality
  - [ ] Establish comprehensive performance benchmarks

- **✅ Quality Gates:**
  - [ ] All tests pass consistently with zero flaky tests
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks remain stable with new test additions
  - [ ] Accessibility tests pass with zero violations
  - [ ] Mutation testing achieves acceptable quality thresholds
