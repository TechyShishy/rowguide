# Code Quality Improvement Plan

## Rowguide Application Analysis & Recommendations

**Version**: 3.0 - Post-Implementation Edition

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a structured improvement plan for the Rowguide application, organized into 9 phases covering documentation, performance optimization, advanced testing, user experience enhancements, and future-proofing strategies.
