Rowguide natively imports anything that looks like a Beadtool 4 PDF file, in addition to its own internal formats, one of which is closely related.

`application/x-rowguide-shorthand` refers to a format that looks like the following:

```plain
(12)A (2)B (1)C (1)B (1)A (3)D
(5)A (8)C (3)E (2)F (1)B (1)A
(4)A (6)C (2)F (1)E (5)C (2)D
(7)C (3)F (3)E (2)B (1)A (4)G
(6)C (2)B (1)A (3)F (5)D (3)F
(6)F (4)C (3)B (2)A (1)C (4)D
```
