/**
 * Shared Constants Module - Application-Wide Constants and Configuration
 *
 * This module serves as the central location for application-wide constants,
 * configuration values, and shared static data. Currently maintained as an
 * empty module but ready for future constant definitions.
 *
 * @fileoverview
 * Reserved module for shared constants that will be used across multiple
 * application features. This module follows the pattern of centralized
 * constant management for maintainability and consistency.
 *
 * **Future Constant Categories:**
 * - **UI Constants**: Default values, thresholds, and limits
 * - **Business Constants**: Pattern-specific values and rules
 * - **Configuration**: Default settings and feature flags
 * - **Validation**: Validation rules and error messages
 *
 * **Usage Guidelines:**
 * - Add constants here when they're used in multiple modules
 * - Use descriptive names with proper TypeScript typing
 * - Group related constants into namespace objects
 * - Document the purpose and valid ranges for each constant
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Example future constants structure
 * export const UI_CONSTANTS = {
 *   MAX_PATTERN_NAME_LENGTH: 100,
 *   DEFAULT_ZOOM_LEVEL: 1.0,
 *   ANIMATION_DURATION: 300
 * } as const;
 *
 * export const PATTERN_LIMITS = {
 *   MAX_ROWS: 1000,
 *   MAX_STEPS_PER_ROW: 500,
 *   MIN_STEP_COUNT: 1
 * } as const;
 * ```
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
