# Shared Module

This directory contains shared utilities, components, and constants used across multiple features.

## Structure

- **components/**: Reusable UI components (notification, loader)
- **utils/**: Utility functions and classes (hierarchical-list, sanity checks)
- **constants/**: Application-wide constants and configuration

## Guidelines

- Components here should be generic and reusable
- Utilities should be pure functions when possible
- Constants should be grouped by domain/purpose
